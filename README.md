# distributed-system-simulator

A *dsitributed system* is a system in which many computers communicate to execute a distributed algorithm.
Here computers are called **nodes**, and communicate through **messages**.

`distributed-system-simulator` can be used to simulate a (relatively) abstract model of such systems.
In this model, there is a set of messages (`M1` and `M2` in this example), and each node's code looks like this:
```
on start:
  ...
 
on message M1:
  ...

on message M2:
  ...
```
To simulate such model, see the **Network**, **Messages** and **Nodes** sections.



In order for this model to be more realistic some additional constraints and characteristics can be defined.

The network connecting the nodes in the system cah have the following behaviours:
- Reliable and instantaneous. Messages are received immediately.
- Reliable. Messages are always received, but transmission is not instantaneous. Depending on how latencies are defined, this may mean that messages can be reordered.
- Fair-loss links: Messages could be lost or duplicated. The only constraint is that if a node keeps sending a message, this will eventually be received.
- Arbitrary links: Messages can be lost or duplicated indefinitely.

To add these specific behaviours in a model, se the **Behaviours** section.


## Network

This class simulates the network. Using `addNode`, `emplaceNode` and `emplaceMultipleNodes` nodes are added to the network. 
To add behaviour objects, methods `addNetworkBehaviour` and `addNodesBehaviour` can be used. If not used, default behaviours will be used.
After doing this, `start` is used to start the simulation, which involves node events and message passing according to the defined times.


## Messages

Any user defined class can be a message, as long as it is a subclass of `dssim::Message`.
`dssim::MessageID` provides an interface to identify messages (which may be required for some algorithms). A possible implementation of this is `dssim::MessageUID`.


## Nodes

A node is a subclass of one or more `dssim::Accepts<T,x>` classes. It should be read as: *The node accepts messages of type T, and the code runs in x ms*.

Defining the execution time of the code for each message allows for realistic simulation 
(e.g. simulating a node that provides some expensive computation and testing how many requests can be handled).
If a node receives a message it does not accept, this will be automatically droppped.

Such node will need to implement the following methods:
- `void onStart()`. This is called when the simulation starts. It has no specified running time, since it should only simulate what happens when a computer is turned on.
(e.g. sending a message to all other nodes to let them know of its existence).
- `void onMessage(T message)` (for all accepted messages `T`). This is called when a message of type `T` is received. 
The message is passed as argument because the message may be carrying data required by the algorithm.

The following methods can be used for nodes communications:
- `getID()`. Get the node's unique id. It is the node's responsibility to let other nodes know about its id if required in the algorithm.
- `sendMessage(T message, int receiver)`. Send a message to a specific node (using its id).
- `void broadcastMessage(T message)` Send a message to all nodes.
- `sendSelfMessage(T message)`. Send a message locally. This message is received reliably and instantly. 
The only difference with a regular function call is that doing this ensures that the times of the calling and called functions are counted correctly.
- `startTimer(T message, double duration)`. Start a timer that after `duration` ms sends a message to the node itself. 
`startTimer(message, 0)` is the same as `sendSelfMessage(message)`.
